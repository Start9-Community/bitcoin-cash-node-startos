# Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN)

Bitcoin Cash Node begins its Initial Block Download — fetching and verifying the
entire BCH chain — the moment it launches; nothing needs configuring first. This
page covers what is specific to running it on StartOS.

## Documentation

- [Bitcoin Cash Node documentation](https://docs.bitcoincashnode.org/) — the upstream operator and configuration reference for `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-cli`.

## What you get on StartOS

- A full BCH node — downloads, verifies, and relays the entire blockchain, then stays in sync.
- A **JSON-RPC interface** on port 8332 that other StartOS services (Fulcrum BCH, BCH
  Explorer, mining pools) and external wallets connect to.
- **ZeroMQ** block and transaction notifications on ports 28332/28333 for services
  that subscribe to them, on by default and switchable under **Node Settings**.
  Double Spend Proof (DSP) ZMQ streams on ports 28334/28335 are always active.
- **Tor** support — when Tor is installed, BCHN routes outbound peer connections through
  Tor. A hybrid mode (clearnet + onion) runs by default; restrict to onion-only under
  **RPC & Peers Settings** if you want a fully private node.
- Multiple networks: **mainnet**, **testnet3**, **testnet4**, **scalenet**, **chipnet**, and **regtest**.

## Getting started

There is no setup wizard and nothing required to start using Bitcoin Cash Node — it
begins syncing on first launch.

Open the **Dashboard** to watch sync progress. A full Initial Block Download takes
anywhere from several hours to a few days depending on your hardware, disk, and
network speed.

Services that depend on Bitcoin Cash Node — Fulcrum BCH, BCH Explorer, mining pools —
install, connect, and configure themselves automatically. They report that they are
waiting for Bitcoin Cash Node to sync until IBD finishes; no manual wiring is needed.

## RPC access

The JSON-RPC API listens on **port 8332** (mainnet). Dependent StartOS services
connect and configure themselves automatically when you install them.

For an external wallet or app, run **Actions → View RPC Credentials** to get the
auto-generated username, password, and port for your selected network.

## Configuration

Settings are actions on the service page, organized into four:

- **Network** — mainnet (default), testnet3, testnet4, scalenet, chipnet, or regtest.
  Switching network changes the data directory and the RPC/P2P port set.
- **Node Settings** — transaction index (`txindex`), pruning, ZeroMQ notifications,
  mempool persistence, database cache/batch size, block-notify script, and wallet
  files. `txindex` is required by Fulcrum BCH and BCH Explorer and is incompatible
  with pruning — enabling pruning turns it off.
- **RPC & Peers Settings** — RPC timeout, threads, and work-queue depth; maximum
  connections (default 125); upload target; bloom-filter serving; allowed networks;
  and manual peers (`addnode`).
- **Mempool & Block Policy** — mempool size, minimum relay fee, expiry, excessive
  block size (default 32 MB), and ancestor/descendant limits.

## Tor networking

By default BCHN runs in hybrid mode: clearnet peers over IPv4/IPv6 and `.onion`
peers over Tor (when Tor is installed). To go fully Tor-only, set **RPC & Peers
Settings → Allowed Networks** to **Tor (.onion)** only — BCHN then disables DNS
seeds and routes everything through Tor. In that mode, add at least one `.onion`
peer under **Add Peers**, since DNS seeds are off.

For inbound onion connectivity (being reachable from Tor): open **Interfaces →
Peer Interface → Add Onion Service** in StartOS. This creates a hidden service
forwarding your `.onion:8333` to the node so peers can reach you.

## Actions

Beyond the four configuration actions above, the service exposes:

- **Node Info** — live version, network, connection count, and sync status (available while running).
- **View RPC Credentials** — display the username, password, and RPC port for a credential.
- **Generate RPC Credentials** — create a new `rpcauth` entry for an external service; the password is shown once.
- **Delete RPC Users** — remove `rpcauth` entries.
- **Reindex Blockchain** — re-verify every block from genesis (rebuilds index and chainstate).
- **Reindex Chainstate** — rebuild the UTXO set from stored block files.
- **Delete Peer List** — remove a corrupted `peers.dat`. Stop the service first.
- **Delete Transaction Index** — remove a corrupted txindex. Stop the service first.
- **Delete Test Network Data** — free disk space by deleting block data for selected test networks (testnet3/testnet4/scalenet/chipnet/regtest). Never touches mainnet, and refuses to delete the network the node is currently running on.

## Network upgrades

Bitcoin Cash activates consensus changes on a schedule, and a node that has not
been updated stops following the main chain once one activates. Keep this service
updated — StartOS will offer the new version as it is packaged, and applying it
before an activation date is the whole of what you need to do. What each upgrade
changes is in the upstream release notes, linked above.

## Limitations

- Blockchain data is not backed up. Backups cover `bitcoin.conf`, credentials, and
  wallet data — block, chainstate, and peer data re-sync after a restore.
- Shutdown can take up to 5 minutes while the database flushes; let it finish rather
  than force-stopping.
- Pruning disables `txindex`, which is required by Fulcrum BCH and BCH Explorer.
- Tor inbound (`-listenonion`) requires a TCP control port not available in the Start9
  Tor service — use the onion-service URL flow in Interfaces instead.
